# #HugsForDeBlasio

Mayor De Blasio is having a harrd time governing right now. 🙁

All the other Covid-19 epicenters gave kids a spring snowday 🌷☃️. But Mayor De Blasio can't decide! 🧐

We know what he needs: lots of cuddly hugs from NYC school kids! 🤗 🐰 After school on Monday, head on down to the Mayor's office and give him a big snuggly, cuddly huggy-wug for courage. 

Don't worry, Bill isn't scared of Covid-19, because there's only an eensy-weensy widdlee bit of [scientific proof that kids get infected at the same rate as adults](https://www.wired.com/story/kids-can-get-covid-19-they-just-dont-get-that-sick/) and that [cities that closed schools saved thousands of lives in the 1918 pandemic](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) and that [massive numbers of children live with—or are cared for primarily by—one or more grandparents](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/09/04/children-living-with-or-being-cared-for-by-a-grandparent/). Bill read [one New York Times op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/opinion/coronavirus-school-closing.html) 🤦 and now he's an _expert_. Listen to experts!

I wonder how many hugs we can give him? A whole schoolful? That'd be 💯
