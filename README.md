# #HugsForDeBlasio

Mayor De Blasio is having a harrd time governing right now.

All the other Covid-19 epicenters gave kids a looong snow day. But Mayor De Blasio can't decide...

We know what he needs... Lots of cuddly hugs from NYC school kids! After school on Monday, head on down to the Mayor's office and give him a big snuggly, cuddly huggy-wug for courage.

Don't worry, Bill isn't scared of Covid-19, because there's only an [eensy-weensy widdlee bit of scientific proof that kids get infected at the same rate as adults](https://www.wired.com/story/kids-can-get-covid-19-they-just-dont-get-that-sick/) and that [cities that closed schools saved thousands of lives in the 1918 pandemic](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) and that [massive numbers of children live with—or are cared for primarily by—one or more grandparents](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/09/04/children-living-with-or-being-cared-for-by-a-grandparent/).

I wonder how many hugs we can give him? A whole schoolfull? That'd be something!
